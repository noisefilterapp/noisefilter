# Noise Filter Web Browser Extension

Noise Filter is an extension for your web browser that hides the comment sections from popular news and social media websites. The extension offers the ability to pause the functionality and whitelist specifi websites. For more information, please visit the [Noise Filter website](https://eff.org) for more information.

## How do I install the extension

Noise Filter is currently available for Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Opera:

* **Firefox**: [Noise Filter for Firefox](https://eff.org)
* **Chrome**: [Noise Filter for Chrome](https://eff.org)
* **Edge**: [Noise Filter for Edge](https://eff.org)
* **Opera**: [Noise Filter for Opera](https://eff.org)

## Using Noise Filter without installing the web extension

If you wish to use the application without downloading the extension, please feel free to download the [content.css](https://eff.org) file. Most modern web browser allow you to insert custom stylesheets, however, using this method you will not have access to the pause and whitelist features that are packaged with the web extension and there is added setup required.

You are also free to use the stylesheet in a new project if you so wish.

## Privacy

One of the central aims when developing this application was to ensure that only data required by the application is used and that the data is not accessible to myself or any other third-party. You can find out more by reading the privacy policy for Noise Filter [here](https://eff.org).
